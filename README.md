# nsh
A really simple shell, running under node. An exercise, really.


To run it, clone me, and run the following commands:
```
npm install
node index.js 
```

You can then run unix commands such as ```ls```, ```cat README.md```, ```who``` and so on.

If you try to call an invalid command you'll get an error.

My main interest here is writing Functional Code, rather than a shell, but let's see what happens.
